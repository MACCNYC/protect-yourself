While the horrible nazis, statists and thugs who harass us aren't like you and me, they can be in that they start out searching for something or someone by Googling them. So if they want to harass you, that may well be where they'll start. We recommend opening an incognito window to search, so you can see what a stranger would see.",

Maybe some of it is person-indexing sites that claim to have your address (they might actually). You can take those down by sending them requests, there are instructions on that later. You might have seen social media profiles; you can take those down using our instructions later on. You might see an account on a random service; you could try logging in and getting rid of it. Make a checklist of everything you want to try to get rid of, and let's try to get rid of some of those things together as we go through the rest of the tutorial!",
